## Project Overview
In the highly competitive world of e-commerce, businesses must do more than attract website visitors â€” they must understand their customersâ€™ behaviors, preferences, and decision-making patterns to remain profitable and sustainable.

This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior of an e-commerce dataset that includes customer demographics, purchase patterns, loyalty indicators, return rate , and engagement with ads. 

# Objective:
The objective is to extract actionable insights that can help optimize marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance revenue generation.

As a Business Analyst, I have conducted comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and developed key performance indicators (KPIs). Visualizations were created to highlight customer segments, behavioral trends, and business-impacting patterns. The final outcomes were summarized in an interactive dashboard using Tableau, enabling data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

# Business Problem Statement
In a competitive digital marketplace, e-commerce companies face a growing challenge: understanding the underlying factors that influence customer behavior in order to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce return rates. Simply tracking transactions is no longer sufficient â€” businesses must gain deeper insights into who their customers are, what drives their decisions, and how those decisions impact profitability.

This project addresses this challenge by analyzing customer behavior data to uncover key patterns and trends that affect purchasing habits, loyalty, satisfaction, and engagement. The analysis helps bridge the gap between raw consumer data and actionable business intelligence.

# Solution Approach
Cleaning the data
Clean and standardize the data for analysis

Identify trends across customer segments

Measure the impact of discounts, loyalty programs, shipping preferences, and digital engagement

Derive and track critical KPIs (e.g., repeat customer rate, average purchase value, return rate)

Visualize insights through a comprehensive Tableau dashboard for business decision-makers
